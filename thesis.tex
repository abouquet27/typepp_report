\chapter{Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The background section introduces the necessary background to understand your
work. This is not necessarily related work but technologies and dependencies
that must be resolved to understand your design and implementation.

This section is usually 3-5 pages.

My project:
0. Introduce C++, Type confusion
1. Explain in more detail and with examples, C++ inheritance and casting
2. Hextype and type++ paradigm and how they handle type confusion

\subsection{C++ and Type Confusion}

C++ is a general purpose programming language widely-used in a lot of domain such as operating systems, 
or machine learning. Types are a core concept in C++ but are source of vulnerabilities. For instance, type confusion 
is a common security issue in C++, which occurs when the compiler misinterpret a pointer's type generally after a wrong typecasting and,
that can lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities. An adversary can then exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, heap corruption and hijack the control-flow.
Such an attack occured in the past in V8 in Google Chrome, where it allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit
heap corruption via a crafted HTML page (CVE-2023-3079). Hence, it is crucial to detect wrong typecasting which induce type confusion. 
Theses wrong casts can occur when casting a pointer outside of the type hierarchy (\texttt{char*} to \texttt{void*}) but they mainly occur with classes and object-oriented programming 
when casting a pointer from a base class to a derived class. In the following, we will explain the object-oriented programming, class hierarchies and inheritance in C++ and how it can lead to type confusion. 
We will then introduce the different type casting operators in C++ and how they can be used to cast a pointer from a type to another. Finally, we will present the different solutions to type confusion and how they handle it.

\subsection{Object-Oriented Programming, Class Hierarchies and Inheritance}
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is about creating objects which are instances of classes that contain both data and functions. This paradigm provides
data abstraction, faster execution and code reusability. 

\adrbqt{Add an example of base-child relationship, Maybe it's better do to an example with a type confusion within}.

Classes are organized in hierarchies, generally with one base class and one derived class, and can inherit attributes and methods from other classes which they
they can use or override. \nb{add mention of where you find this in your example}A derived class can have multiple base classes and thus possesses all the methods and attributes from its base classes. 
Furthermore, a derived class is a subtype of its base class, meaning that a derived class can be used in place of its base class. This concept which is called 
Polymporphism, is remarkably practical but leads to some issues. For instance, when a base class has two derived classes that are not directly related to each other, 
it is possible to cast a pointer from one derived class to another in type casting by the base class.
This is called type confusion and can lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.
\adrbqt{}
\subsection{Type Casting}
Typecasting is the operation of casting a pointer from a type to another. C++ provides four casting operators: \texttt{static\_cast}, \texttt{dynamic\_cast}, 
\texttt{const\_cast} and \texttt{reinterpret\_cast}
\adrbqt{Add an example of type casting}

\texttt{\textbf{const\_cast}<target-type>(expression)} revokes the constness or volatileness of an object. Due to the operator's behaviour, it does not impact type hierarchies and 
thus does not lead to type confusion altough there are some issues with const\_cast.

\texttt{\textbf{static\_cast}<target-type>(expression)} cast an expression to a specified type while check at compile-time but not at runtime. Therefore, this reduces cast verification to checking the types 
in the type hierarchy. It does not guarantee the types are compatible at runtime and places the onus back on programmers to ensure type correctness. Hence, it leads to a type confusion vulnerability when misused i.e.,
casting from the base class to a derived class or when casting a pointer to a void pointer.

\texttt{\textbf{reinterpret\_cast}<target-type>(expression)} similarly to static\_cast, it casts an expression to a specified type by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern but with the difference 
that it does not check neither at compile time nor at runtime. Hence, it can potentially cast two incompatible types and lead to type confusion. 
It is also the programmer's responsibility to ensure the correctness of the target-type and the type of expression.

\texttt{\textbf{dynamic\_cast}<target-type>(expression)} cast safely an expression to a specified type and checks at compile-time and at runtime, unlike \texttt{static\_cast}, if the types are compatible. 
To achieve the runtime check, \texttt{dynamic\_cast} must leverage heavy-weight metadata, Run Time Type Information (RTTI). However, RTTI is only available when the class has at least one virtual function 
and thus is polymorphic, which constraint to use \texttt{dynamic\_cast} only on polymorphic classes.

Finally, C-style typecasting exists in C++ due to backward compatibility between both languages but highly discouraged due for instance to its lack of clarity for programmers. 
Furthermore, the compiler translate C-style typecasting to (i) \texttt{const\_cast}, (ii) \texttt{static\_cast} and (iii) \texttt{reinterpret\_cast} in this preferred order which passes on the underlying types confusions.

\subsection{Solutions, Hextype and type++}

As previously mentioned, type confusion vulnerabilities can lead to some memory corruption and security vulnerabilities which products such as Telegram (CVE-2021-31318, CVE-
2021-31317) or Google Chromium (CVE-2021-30627,CVE-2022-1096, CVE-2022-1134, CVE-2022-2295) are exposed to. Hence, it is a problem that require to be handled for developer and user safety. 
The compiler checks statically the correctness of each cast to ensure that the types are compatible but it does not guarantee the same correctness at runtime, 
because for instance an object of a derived class can be used in place of an object of a base class due to Polymporphism and vice versa. \adrbqt{Add in the same example} 
To detect type confusion at runtime, there exists two approaches: (i) relying on disjoint metadata, such as type table to keep track of each type of each object or trees for type hierarchy, and 
(ii) relying on existing metadata, such as Runtime Type Information (RTTI) and vtables. 
Generally, the first approach is more efficient because it covers more types but it introduces overhead and performance issues. The second is faster but less efficient due to its limitation to polymorphic classes and it caused some crash issue. 
In this paper, we will focus and compare on two solutions: Hextype and type++. 
Both solutions checks types correctness at runtime but they differ in their approach.Comparing them offers a perspective on the effectiveness of each approach, despite the age difference between the development of these two solutions.
Hextype is older and relies on disjoint metadata to achieve types correctness. 
Type++ is a recent solution and relies on existing metadata to achieve types correctness but unlike an approach based solely on existing metadata for Polymporphism object,
it extends this by adding a vtable pointer to each object to enforce efficiency, cover more types and avoid crash issue. In the following, we will detail how Hextype and type++ work.
